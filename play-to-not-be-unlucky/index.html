In any game there is a probability that you will win or lose. When you pull the handle on a slot machine there is a probability that you will win more than you bet. When you throw money into a stock there is a probability that you will gain more than you put in. Both games can be modeled using discrete distributions. The difference is that the distribution for the slot machine is easy to discover (a slot machine is created for you to lose money after all) while the distribution for throwing money behind a stock is not possible to discover in its entirety (the distribution exists but there are far too many variables for it to be found).</p><p>Hedge funds exist, therefore variables that heavily influence the distribution related to picking and selling stocks must be partially discoverable; even further, discoverable in a way in which these funds can charge <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two_and_twenty.asp>2 and 20</a>. I stress that these variables are only partially discoverable, which means you may think that you know how variable X behaves until you do not — variables are not independent. An example of a way in which hedge funds partially discover variables that impact stock price is via intense research. If a hedge fund wants to jump into batteries they will throw money and time (mostly money) into learning everything there is to know about the battery market. Money gives them access to top-tier analysts and hard to source information. Then they just give those analysts time to bounce ideas off each other and bring everything together to build an investment thesis. Turns out that throwing money/time into learning everything you possibly can about a variable and how it impacts the distribution of the game you are playing is a good way to not be unlucky. Hedge funds play to not be unlucky.</p><p>The stock market is not the only high stakes game in town. Social media is also a game with followers as the reward. In the beginning of Youtube it was a lot easier to find the formula to not be unlucky. There were less variables impacting the discrete distribution related to follower count, people were just putting videos they thought other people would like online. When it is easy to find variables to not be unlucky the rewards are either minimal (it was hard to monetize your youtube following in 2006) or everyone is taking advantage of those variables making it progressively harder to not be unlucky (it has become progressively harder over the years to become Youtube famous). Those who gained a following in the early days when it was easier to not be unlucky can still cash in on their following if they stuck with it, say someone like PewDiePie. For those looking to garner a Youtube following in 2021, you have to deal with finding a variable that allows you to not be unlucky, in conjunction with battling the content recommendation algorithm — an external distribution that you need to find ways not to be unlucky with as well. In the game of social media, taking advantage of a variable to not be unlucky early seems to be a good strategy since that variable will quickly become saturated due to social media&rsquo;s low barrier to entry.</p><p>To win in a game where the distribution is not discoverable you have to find ways to not be unlucky. If you are playing the game to be lucky then you will not consistently win.</p></article><div class=pagination><a href=https://antoninodimaggio.com/northern-canada/>&#171; Northern Canada</a></div></section><br></section></main><footer class="row middle-xs center-xs"><div class="col-xs-3 col-md-2"><a target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://twitter.com/tonyjdimaggio>Twitter</a></div><div class="col-xs-3 col-md-2"><a target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://github.com/antoninodimaggio>GitHub</a></div><div class="col-xs-3 col-md-2"><a target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://linkedin.com/in/antoninodimaggio>LinkedIn</a></div><div class=col-xs-12>Copyright &copy; 2021 Antonino DiMaggio.</div></footer><script src=https://antoninodimaggio.com/js/src/main.min.ff76d31cde7f4bb4be57eaec2fc74022b76f5c423510a2563f282ef0945e3d17.js type=text/javascript></script></body></html>
