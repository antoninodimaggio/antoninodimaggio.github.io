Renewables, such as solar and wind, are beginning to reach economies of scale and, in some cases, are already cheaper than more traditional power plants burning coal and natural gas [[1]](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/72842.pdf){: rel="nofollow"}. For the purposes of this post, I will mainly focus on utility-scale solar, which will help to simplify the conversation. Solar is improving fast with photovoltaics, inverters, and batteries getting better everyday. Solar is economically cheaper, therefore in an ideal [homo economicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus){: rel="nofollow"} framed world solar should be everywhere. The challenge that is stopping solar from growing at an even faster rate comes down to simple supply and demand.

## Framing The Problem: Supply and Demand
**Supply** is how much power is being generated. **Demand** is how much power people want to consume. Now let's abstract away all of the complexities involved in electrical power generation/delivery and state that the utility owns everything (this is known as an ideal regulated electricity market). The utility owns the power plants, transmission lines, substations, and even the meter attached to your house. Therefore, the utility is the sole agent in determining how much power it should have to supply to meet demand.

Let's say the utilities main goal is to provide the cheapest power possible for its customers while generating a reasonable profit to expand and take care of its employees in the future. Whether this is best possible through a regulated or deregulated system is a question as old as formal economics itself, with Adam Smith addressing the topic in [The Wealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations){: rel="nofollow"}. Regardless of policy, renewables have to be thrown into the mix in order to achieve the cheapest electricity price possible. This is where supply and demand becomes complex.

### Dispatchable vs Non-Dispatchable
A [variable energy source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_renewable_energy){: rel="nofollow"} is non-dispatchable since it can not be directly controlled: solar panels only produce electricity when the sun is shining. [Dispatchable generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispatchable_generation){: rel="nofollow"} is a power source that can be controlled: a natural gas power plant can adjust output somewhat easily. The control that fossil-fuel based dispatchable generation provides is needed and is not going anywhere anytime soon. Therefore, we have to find a way to efficiently integrate utility-scale solar into the power generation mix. The only way to do this successfully is to find a way to reliably forecast the power output of renewables. If we can forecast the power output of renewables we can then determine the amount of energy that should be put into storage as well as get a better idea on how to better throttle traditional dispatchable power sources. So forecasting renewable energy is the solution, but how exactly do we do that? The answer is to use **machine learning**.

Figure. 2 is known as the duck curve and is perhaps the best visual to understand the dynamics of supply and demand when renewable resources are added into the power generation mix. <span style="color:blue"> Blue: </span> demand for power, <span style="color:orange"> Orange: </span> demand for dispatchable power (mainly fossil fuels), and <span style="color:grey"> Grey: </span>  supply of solar power. Notice how demand for power is highest in the evening.

## Renewable Energy Forecasting
Remember that we are a utility and our main goal is to predict the amount of power generated by utility-scale solar installations. The main variable that affects the power output of solar is atmospheric conditions. The good news is that since we are a utility we have access to tons of past solar performance data. We also have access to [widely available](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/){: rel="nofollow"} irradiance and atmospheric data; **irradiance** is simply how strong the sun is shining.

Machine learning models, such as neural networks, are good at making predictions when trained on a lot of data. We have a lot of data, therefore we should be able to make fairly accurate predictions. We can then use these predictions to make recommendations to the grid operators. An example recommendation would go something like this:

**AI**: "The global horizontal irradiance is lower than initially expected today. At 1 PM begin to ramp up power production by a factor of 1.5 at the natural gas power plant to meet demand."

**GRID OPERATOR**: "I agree with this suggestion. Approve the systems recommendation and schedule a ramp up in production at 1 PM."

The accuracy of variable renewable energy forecasts generally increases at shorter time intervals [[2]](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65728.pdf){: rel="nofollow"} . This is a huge hurdle since these small time frames are often not large enough for grid operators to make actionable decisions. For traditional fossil-fuel based power plants it is not economically viable to quickly ramp up production on short notice, in fact the economics of these power plants only works if they are running all the time [[3]](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/53504.pdf){: rel="nofollow"} . Therefore, machine learning models have to make accurate predictions at variable time intervals.

### We Are Making Progress
Solar and wind forecasting is a hot area of research with a simple Google search returning a bunch of peer-reviewed articles. Some methods use more traditional statistical models while others use neural networks â€” the approaches vary widely.

Machine learning based methods require a lot of data and a lot of compute. A notable player emerging in the renewable energy forecasting space is Google's DeepMind who recently explored how [machine learning can boost the value of wind energy](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy){: rel="nofollow"} .

Essentially, Google has a couple of renewable energy projects that help to power their data centers. DeepMind took historical turbine data generated from 700 megawatts of capacity in the central United States along with widely available weather forecasts to train a neural network. DeepMind's system was configured to predict the wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generation. The system also recommends how to make optimal hourly delivery commitments to the power grid a full day in advance. DeepMind claims to have boosted the value of their wind energy by 20%. Therefore, DeepMind has established that renewable energy forecasting on long time scales is not only possible but can increase the value of renewable energy resources.

## Key Takeaways
Renewables are now economically competitive with fossil-fuel based power generation. To integrate renewables into the grid we have to accurately forecast renewable energy output. To forecast renewable energy output we can use machine learning. Some of the challenges associated with using machine learning to predict power output is the large amounts of data and compute needed to train models that can predict power output at variable time scales.
