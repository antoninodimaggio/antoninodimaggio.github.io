> A short explanation of my intentions and aspirations for this blog.

<!--more-->


I have always liked writing but I have never really found a comfortable place to do it. At university I felt burdened by a laundry list formalities. On social media I feel no sense of permanence or order. A blog generally solves some of these problems. I can write in my own style without penalty and everything is in one organized place.

I plan on writing about machine learning, renewable energy, and everything in between. Everything in between referring to what seems to be my ever changing interests.

Lets see how this goes.
