At university I felt burdened by a laundry list formalities. On social media I feel no sense of permanence or order. A blog generally solves some of these problems. I can write in my own style without penalty and everything is in one organized place.
I plan on writing about machine learning, renewable energy, and everything in between.</description></item></channel></rss>
