It seems idotic that people would, for example, argue on Twitter for hours on end over a statement that is completely false. These arguments, however, are not idiotic. They are a result of human nature.
Paul Graham says “The statements that make people mad are the ones they worry might be believed” — this also applies to statements that people worry might not be believed.</description></item><item><title>Posts</title><link>https://antoninodimaggio.com/posts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antoninodimaggio.com/posts/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Integrating Renewables Into The Grid With Machine Learning</title><link>https://antoninodimaggio.com/integrating-renewables-into-the-grid-with-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antoninodimaggio.com/integrating-renewables-into-the-grid-with-machine-learning/</guid><description>Renewables, such as solar and wind, are beginning to reach economies of scale and, in some cases, are already cheaper than more traditional power plants burning coal and natural gas [1]. For the purposes of this post, I will mainly focus on utility-scale solar, which will help to simplify the conversation. Solar is improving fast with photovoltaics, inverters, and batteries getting better everyday. Solar is economically cheaper, therefore in an ideal homo economicus framed world solar should be everywhere.</description></item><item><title>Predict Vehicle Speed Using Dense Optical Flow</title><link>https://antoninodimaggio.com/predict-vehicle-speed-using-dense-optical-flow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antoninodimaggio.com/predict-vehicle-speed-using-dense-optical-flow/</guid><description>I stumbled across the comma.ai speed challenge so I decided to give it a shot. There are two dashcam videos: one video is used for training (20,400 frames @ 20 FPS) and the other video is used for testing (10,798 frames @ 20 FPS). The training video is accompanied by the ground truth speed at each frame. The objective is to predict the speed of the test video at each frame.</description></item><item><title>Introductions Are In Order</title><link>https://antoninodimaggio.com/introductions-are-in-order/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antoninodimaggio.com/introductions-are-in-order/</guid><description>I have always liked writing but I have never really found a comfortable place to do it. At university I felt burdened by a laundry list formalities. On social media I feel no sense of permanence or order. A blog generally solves some of these problems. I can write in my own style without penalty and everything is in one organized place.
I plan on writing about machine learning, renewable energy, and everything in between.</description></item></channel></rss>
